With former ace CC Sabathia long gone, the Indians are relying on Lee more than ever. They need him to set the tone for a rotation that enters the season with no shortage of question marks and concerns. Lee certainly has the mentality for the job, as his unshakable consistency, in terms of fastball command and aggressiveness, carried him to new heights in '08. He was one of just seven pitchers since 1920 to win 22 of his first 25 decisions, and his ERA was the lowest by an AL left-hander this decade. There will, however, be a worry that Lee's career-high workload (223 1/3 innings) could affect him in '09.

The 13 victories are two more than he's had against any other team in the Major Leagues. Last season, when Peavy struggled with getting run support, he was still 4-0 with a 2.42 ERA against Los Angeles. Pitching at PETCO Park, Peavy had a 1.74 ERA last season, though  again, run support cost him as he went just 5-5. Peavy pitched in the World Baseball Classic in March and struggled, posting a 14.40 ERA. But after making adjustments with Padres pitching coach Darren Balsley -- over the phone, no less, while Peavy was still with Team USA in the World Baseball Classic -- the right-hander returned a better pitcher, in his words. After cleaning up some things in his delivery, Peavy delivered two gems to close Cactus League play, holding the A's scoreless over six innings and then doing the same to the White Sox in five innings in his last start of the spring. Peavy's stuff, especially his slider, has looked exceptionally sharp upon his return from the Classic. The slider was a critical pitch for him in 2007, when he ran away with the NL Cy Young, leading the league in wins (19), ERA (2.54) and strikeouts (240). Peavy doesn't expect any lingering issues with his arm like he did in 2006 after competing in the Classic. He came to Spring Training early and adhered to a stringent throwing program to get ready for the tournament and the regular season.\",\n",

He was 2-1 against the Padres last season, but the one loss came when he was pitching hurt and was followed by a three-week stint on the disabled list with shoulder tendinitis. Kuroda is the second Japanese pitcher to start for the Dodgers on Opening Day, following Hideo Nomo, who did it in 2003 and 2004. Choosing to focus on his second season as a Major League pitcher, Kuroda bypassed a chance to pitch for Team Japan in the recent World Baseball Classic.&#xd;&#xa;<p>&#xd;&#xa;In his last tuneup for this start, he allowed the Giants one run on four hits in three innings, with three strikeouts and no walks.

During that impressive showing, Halladay did not encounter the Tigers, but he has handled Detroit well over his career. In 15 outings against his Opening Day opponent, Halladay has gone 11-2 with a crisp 1.93 ERA. Pitching at Rogers Centre has also been something that Halladay has enjoyed over his career.

A return to a lower arm angle seems to have helped bring back much of his old velocity, bumping the fastball to 97 mph, while a change of stance with his landing leg is expected to help give him better command on all of his pitches. Part of last year's struggles included an Aug. 11 loss to the Blue Jays at Comerica Park in his first career outing against Toronto, which hit him for six runs on seven hits in 4 1/3 innings, the fourth straight loss in a season that included three different four-game losing streaks, two of them in the season's second half.\",\n",

A 24th-round pick in the 2004 First-Year Player Draft, he was the Organizational Pitcher of the Year in 2005 and made his big league debut two years later. He won his first career start with Oakland but lost his next eight decisions and finished with a 6.72 ERA in 20 games -- the third-highest ERA in club history for a pitcher with more than 70 innings. In 2008 he was called up four times, making nine relief appearances before finishing the year with 10 consecutive starts. Shut down for the season on Sept. 11 with a strained groin, Braden posted a 3.97 ERA as a starter for the year and entered Spring Training as the team's projected No. 4 starter. After a string of strong outings early in Cactus League play and Duchscherer's injury, however, Braden was rewarded for following the coaching staff's orders to pound the strike zone and pitch to contact. Poised to make his first Opening Day start, Braden has a 2.25 career ERA against the Angels and went 1-0 with a 2.08 ERA in five appearances against them last season.\",\n",

His 68 victories at U.S. Cellular Field also stand as the stadium's top total. Buehrle enters the season needing just 17 starts to pass Joel Horlen for seventh place on the franchise all-time list and needs just 16 strikeouts to move him past Gary Peters and into the top five on the White Sox career ledger in that category. He has never been a hard thrower, but Buehrle relies on movement and pinpoint location to regularly get the job done.\",\n",

In addition, Niemann seems to be ironing out his mechanics, which sometimes is a difficult undertaking for a pitcher of his height.

The right-hander had to battle through five innings, giving up four runs on eight hits. The feeling of the Twins staff was that the numbers were a tad worse than Blackburn's actual performance as many of the hits were bloopers or jammed shots. But the pitcher said that he was going to work between starts on keeping his ball down in the zone as some of his pitches were a little high -- although that was perhaps a result of some first-outing jitters. In his next start, Blackburn will return to Chicago, where he delivered a gem of a performance in the club's 1-0 loss to the White Sox in a one-game tiebreaker for the AL Central title last September.\",\n",

He's gone eight innings in both starts and thrown over 100 pitches each time, compiling a season ERA of just 1.69. Once an odd man out of the Twins' rotation plans, Perkins now seems like an anchor and has been Minnesota's best starter early in the season.
